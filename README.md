### Pre-commit hooks

This repository used [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage and run certain git hooks. Hook definitions can be found within the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

Run the following to add the hooks to your local repository:

### Useful commands

The `README` for every chart is auto generated using [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs). This is defined as a pre-commit hook. If you want to run it manually, you can run:

```

The [CT (Chart Testing)](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) tool is used to lint and validate charts. You can run this via:
